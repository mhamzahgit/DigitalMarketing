# Digital Marketing Campaign Project

This repository features our final deliverable for the Digital Marketing Campaign Project. Our mission was twofold: to discover which customer groups are most likely to convert in our digital campaigns and to translate those insights into clear, actionable recommendations.

## What’s Inside

* **FINAL-REPORT-DIGITAL-MARKETING.pdf**: The complete project narrative, analysis code, and visualizations, compiled via R Markdown.
* **README.md**: This guide, designed to walk you through the report’s structure and explain how to interpret the findings.

## The Journey

1. **Framing the Challenge**
   We began by defining our business objective: understand the digital behaviors and demographics that drive conversions. From there, we formulated key questions to steer our analysis and model-building efforts.

2. **Digging into the Data**
   A thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) set the stage. We cleaned and validated our dataset, then examined individual features (like ad spend and click-through rates) alongside relationships between them. Statistical tests (ANOVA) helped us confirm which differences were significant.

3. **Building Predictive Models**
   To predict who converts, we engineered new features, balanced our data using SMOTE, and trained three models: Logistic Regression, K‑Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest. Each model’s performance was measured by accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC/AUC, allowing us to identify the best approach for our goals.

4. **Uncovering Customer Segments**
   K‑Means clustering revealed natural groupings in our audience—such as high-income prospects or deeply engaged social followers. We profiled these segments, linking quantitative cluster labels to real customer archetypes.

5. **Turning Numbers into Strategy**
   Finally, we wove together modeling insights and segment profiles to craft targeted recommendations. These include optimizing budget allocation, tailoring creative assets to specific audiences, and refining future campaign parameters for maximum ROI.

## How to Read the Report

* **Sections 1–2 (Objectives & EDA)** introduce the problem and ensure you trust the data foundation.
* **Sections 3–4 (Modeling & Segmentation)** dive into the methods and highlight the predictive power and distinct customer groups.
* **Section 5 (Recommendations)** translates all findings into a concise guide for marketing teams: where to invest next and how to speak directly to high‑value audiences.

We hope this narrative roadmap helps you navigate our analysis and apply the insights to drive more effective digital campaigns.
